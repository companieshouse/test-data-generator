Test data generator
==========
Service for generating and storing random test company data. This includes company profile, authentication code, filing history, officers and people of significant control.

As new filings are exposed to external software vendors more test data options should be added to this service and the relevant public specs/docs updated.

Requirements
------------
In order to run the API locally you'll need the following installed on your machine:

- [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)


Getting started
---------------
1. Run `make`
2. Run `./start.sh`

Docker
------

There is a Docker service for this project called `test-data-generator` which can be used for development and test in the CHS Dev Env.

The docker compose file for this service is `docker-chs-development/services/test-utils/test-data-generator.docker-compose.yaml ` for correct operation under CHS Dev Env pay attention to the following clauses:

    environment:
      - TEST_DATA_GENERATOR_PORT=4022
      - MONGODB_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017
      - BARCODE_SERVICE_URL=http://barcode-generator:18101
      - HUMAN_LOG=1
      - API_URL=http://localhost:8080
    expose:
      - 4022
    ports:
      - "4022:4022"

A `Tiltfile.dev` is included in this project to allow development mode to be enabled.

### Usage
In order to use the generator, there are 2 possible endpoints that can be used.

- POST: Sending a POST request on the following endpoint `{Base URL}/test-data/company)` will generate a new test company and accompanying Authcode. There is an optional parameter which is CompanySpec. When added to the request body will alter generated company to be based in Scotland or Northern Ireland but will default to England/Wales. An usage example looks like this: `{"jurisdiction":"scotland"}`
- DELETE: Sending a DELETE request on the endpoint `{Base URL}/test-data/company/{companyNumber}` will delete the test company. There is a required parameter that is Authcode which needs to be included in the request body to be allowed to delete the test company. An usage example looks like this: `{"auth_code":"222222"}`
- Health Check: Sending a GET request on the endpoint `{Base URL}/test-data/healthcheck` will return a status code and an empty response body.
